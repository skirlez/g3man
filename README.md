# Forgery Manager
A mod manager for the https://github.com/Skirlez/nubbys-forgery/ modloader

## TODO
- This project does not benefit at all from being C++. If it were C#, and using something like Avalonia,
we could include UndertaleModLib directly, and that would be nice.

## Compiling

### Nix/NixOS
If you just want to build: `nix build` or `nix run`

If you want to develop, run `nix develop`, and from there you have `make`. You also have `gdb` and `bear`.

### Other Linux distros
TODO (look at the flake.nix file for required dependencies)

### Windows
Install MSYS2, use the Mingw64 shell
